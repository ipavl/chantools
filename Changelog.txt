	- commands now have error catching
	- file paths now use \\ as opposed to /

	- !pingme off now works correctly
	- !ops will now output the list of names in the "ping list" to the staff channel to alert channel operators
	- added !kick and !ban to "anonymously" kick/ban users from the "watch" channel via the staff channel
		- bot will request channel operator status from services (ChanServ), kick/ban desired user, and then de-op itself
		- will be logged in staff channel
		- to prevent abuse, security should be placed on the staff channel as the bot will only accept commands from that channel

	- added !ops
		- when typed in a "watch channel", the operators of said channel will be pinged in a "staff channel" that
		  someone needs operator attention in the "watch channel"
		- !pingme on will add the user who used the command to the ping list
		- !pingme off will remove the user who used the command from the ping list (unfinished)
		- TODO: read and output the ping list to the staff channel when !ops is used in the watch channel
	- added !debug
		- allows the owner of the bot to control the bot
			- !debug join <channel> will ask the bot to join a channel
